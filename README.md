#Insights

There are more below average reviews for restaurants that deliver online than for those that deliver online. The rate is 94%. for Restaurants that deliver online with an above-average rating, it is 49%

The rate of restaurants that deliver online represents only 26%, while those that do not deliver are 74%.

Among the data collected for analysis, only an average of 17.8% corresponds to restaurants that make reservations.

Countries on the Asian, Middle Eastern and North American continents tend to have a better rating rate per restaurant compared to other countries.

Restaurants in the United States have restaurants with more expensive food, while the cheapest is in Brazil.
